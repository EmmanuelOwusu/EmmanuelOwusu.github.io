This talk was given at African Master's of Machine Intelligence (AMMI-Ghana) during the Computer Vision Group meeting.


# SUMMARY

Below is the Summary of the the talk on .

1.  Very deep Neural Networks  are difficult to train because of vanishing and
 exploding gradients problems.
 
2. Residual network also be know as skip connection.

3. Skip connection makes you take the activation from one layer and
suddenly feed it to another layer even much deeper in Neural Network which allows
you to train large NNs even with layers greater than 100.
