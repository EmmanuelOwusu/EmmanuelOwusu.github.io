# SUMMARY ON WINE PRICE PREDICTION PROJECT


* Predicting the price of wine based on a collection of reviews and other product features.

* We used the Random Forest Regressor and the XGBoost Algorithm to predict the prices of wine.

    * Feature Engineering

    * Label Encoding
    
    * One Hot Encoding
    
     * TF-IDF  (term frequencyâ€“inverse document frequency)
     
     * 10-Fold cross validation applied in both models.

* Random Forest performs better than XGBoost.

* Combining models gives even better results.

* Two models were used with cross validation. Their predictions were averaged and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 20.4 was achieved.
