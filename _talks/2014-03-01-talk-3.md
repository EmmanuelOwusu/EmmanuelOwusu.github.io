 This project is on Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) and presented to Students and Tutors  at African Master's in Machine Intelligence(AMMI GHANA).

# Summary on Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR).

* An optimal control is a set of differential equations describing the
paths of the control variables that minimize the cost function.

* A Linear Quadratic Problem is a problem where the system dynamics
are described by a set of linear differential equations and the cost is
described by a quadratic function.

* The goal of Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) is to stabilize a system.
