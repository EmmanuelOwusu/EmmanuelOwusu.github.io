I worked on a topic called Linear Quadratic Regulators (LQR) and presented it to my class (AMMI GHANA).

# SUMMARY ON LQR

* An optimal control is a set of differential equations describing the
paths of the control variables that minimize the cost function.

* A linear quadratic problem is a problem where the system dynamics
are described by a set of linear differential equations and the cost is
described by a quadratic function.

* The goal of LQR is to stabilize a system
