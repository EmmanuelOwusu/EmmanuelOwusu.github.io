The research proposes a self-supervised proxy task based on contrastive learning for
medical image analysis. The network is pre-trained using a triplet loss to learn
representative features in the data, followed by fine-tuning on the main segmentation
task. The proposed method improves segmentation performance compared to the
baseline U-Net method without self-supervision on white matter hyperintensities
segmentation
